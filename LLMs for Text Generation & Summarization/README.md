# LLMs for Text Generation & Summarization

This repository contains materials for a comprehensive workshop on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation and summarization tasks.

---

## Overview

This workshop explores modern approaches to text summarization using transformer-based architectures, covering both extractive and abstractive techniques. Participants will gain practical experience implementing multi-stage summarization pipelines, controlling generation parameters, and evaluating summary quality using various metrics.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- **Compare multiple summarization approaches:** Understand and apply extractive, abstractive, and hybrid techniques for text summarization.
- **Control summary generation:** Adjust summary length, style, and focus using advanced control parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p, etc.).
- **Evaluate summaries comprehensively:** Go beyond ROUGE by assessing factual consistency, semantic similarity, and human-centric metrics.
- **Build multi-stage summarization pipelines:** Combine different techniques to create more effective summarization systems.
- **Handle complex and multimodal documents:** Summarize long, multi-document, and multimodal (text + images) content.
- **Engineer effective prompts:** Use prompt engineering frameworks (like CO-STAR) for structured and controlled output.

## Installation <!-- This might be better as Environment Setup -->


**Assumptions & Requirements:**

- **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, or Windows (with WSL recommended for Windows users)
- **Python:** 3.8 or higher ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **pip:** Python's package manager (included by default)
- **venv:** For environment isolation (included with Python 3.8+)
- **git:** For cloning the repository ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

**Setup Steps:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ghana-Data-Science-Summit-IndabaX-Ghana/IndabaX25.git

cd "IndabaX25/LLMs for Text Generation & Summarization"


# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file with:
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

- Basic Text Generation

- Establishing evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BLEU)

### Part II: Core Summarization Techniques
- Extractive summarization
- Abstractive Summarization & Control Parameters
- Evaluation metrics for summarization

- Building multi-stage summarization pipelines

### Part III: Advanced Applications
- Complex and MultiDocument Summarization
- Multimodal summarization (text + images)
- Practical exercises for building custom systems
